# Double-Pendulum-Cart-System

This project was done under the course ENPM667 - Control of Robotic Systems

The dynamic equation of the system, written using Euler Lagrange equations was linearized about a given point using Jacobian Linearization. This helped formulate the state space representation of the system. 

The linearized system was simulated using the LQR Controller.

To simulate the non-linear system, Simulink models were developed.
